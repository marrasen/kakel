# kakel

A terminal emulator in Go, for Windows and Linux, drawn on the GPU with
[gunim](https://github.com/marrasen/gunim) and animated all through.

It runs a shell on a local pseudo-terminal -- a PTY on Unix, a ConPTY on
Windows -- or on another machine over SSH, feeds the output through a VT
emulator of its own, and draws the character grid with gunim. A screen
that did not change draws nothing at all, and one that changed in part
redraws that part.

It is also a window manager for the things a terminal drags along with
it: panes on several machines at once, a file manager in a pane, a file
viewer, tunnels, and a way to hand a few panes to an agent without
handing over the machine.

Kakel is Swedish for tile. It was called gridterm until September 2026;
see [Coming from gridterm](#coming-from-gridterm).

## Install

**One line.** These fetch the newest release, check it against
`SHA256SUMS`, and install it for you alone, with no administrator.

On Windows, in PowerShell:

```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marrasen/kakel/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

On Linux:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marrasen/kakel/main/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows kakel goes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\kakel`, with a Start
menu shortcut and an entry under Installed apps, which removes it again.
On Linux it goes to `~/.local/share/kakel`, with a desktop file and a
link at `~/.local/bin/kakel`. A kakel installed in `~/.local/bin` by an
older release moves itself there the first time it starts.

**Or download a build.** The [releases page](https://github.com/marrasen/kakel/releases)
has a zip for Windows and a tarball for Linux, both amd64, with
`SHA256SUMS` beside them. Unpack it and run it: it opens kakel's
installer, which also offers a desktop shortcut, a start with the
computer, and automatic updates, or runs it as it is. Settings ›
General › Install kakel… installs a copy run that way later. `kakel -install` and
`kakel -uninstall` do the same from a shell, and `kakel -uninstall`
offers to take your settings and saved servers too.

**Updates.** An installed release looks for a newer one a minute after it
starts and once a day after. Settings › General › New releases says what it does then:
tell you (the default), install it by itself, or nothing. Told, a window
shows what's new; Update Now downloads it, with its progress shown, and
restarts kakel into it. Installed by itself, it starts the next time
kakel does, and kakel then says what it brought. About kakel › What's
New shows every release's notes.

**Or with Go.** Every build is pure Go, with no C toolchain on either
platform:

```
go install github.com/marrasen/kakel@latest
```

On Windows, add `-ldflags -H=windowsgui`, or a console window flashes up
as kakel starts.

**Or from source.** [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## Start

```
kakel                          # into the tray; started again, a window with your login shell
kakel -ssh user@host           # a shell on another machine
kakel -e 'vim /etc/hosts'      # one command
kakel -font-size 18            # 8 to 96 pixels
kakel -font-family 'Cascadia Mono'
kakel -list-fonts              # the monospace families installed
kakel -tray                    # into the tray, and only there, as with the computer
kakel -launcher                # the launcher, from a key the desktop binds
kakel -quit                    # ends the kakel running
```

Started with nothing to do, kakel goes to the tray and takes the
launcher's key: a window opens from the tray icon, the launcher, or
kakel started again. Where there is no tray, a window opens at once.

With `-ssh` the window opens first and connects in a pane, so it asks
about an unknown host key in a dialog and keeps the account of how the
machine was reached. A new pane or split opens on that machine too, and
its heading in the Servers pane offers the rest: files, a command, a
tunnel and the account.

Text is drawn in Go Mono, compiled into the binary, until you pick an
installed family with `-font-family` or in Settings › Appearance, which
remembers your pick for next time. `-font`
takes font files instead, comma separated, in the order regular, bold,
italic, bold italic. Only the regular font is required: a style you
leave out borrows one you gave.

## What it does

- **A real terminal.** bash, vim and less all run: alternate screen,
  scrollback, true colour, the text attributes, cursor shapes, mouse
  modes, bracketed paste and synchronized updates. Wide characters and
  combining marks are handled, and the box-drawing and block characters
  are drawn to the exact cell size, so a framed TUI has unbroken lines.
- **Shells here and on other machines**, over one SSH connection that
  carries several panes, a file session and tunnels at once.
- **A file manager in a pane**, beside your terminals, on this machine
  or any server: split, docked and moved between windows like a
  terminal, in the same theme, with copying and moving between machines
  that runs in the background and says how far it has got.
- **A file viewer without a shell**: paging, search, hex, tailing,
  syntax colour, and JSON logs laid out as logs.
- **Tunnels**, local, remote and SOCKS5, each with a pane saying what it
  is carrying.
- **One kakel working inside another**, and through it on the servers
  it is connected to, including joining a program already running over
  there so both people see it.
- **Panes shared with an agent** over MCP, where one code reaches
  exactly the panes you shared and nothing else.
- **Motion that says what happened.** The pane switcher zooms from
  every pane into the one you pick, and the window arrives and leaves
  with a fade. When something happens
  that you may be looking away from, the window sends an echo out past
  its edges, onto the desktop: red for a failure, green for work done,
  amber for a bell, and a faint grey ring while a connection is made. A
  theme sets the echo's colours and strength.
- **Themes that change more than colour.** A theme sets how round and
  how roomy the window is, and how it moves: Phosphor is a tight green
  screen, Marshmallow a round and bouncy pastel,
  and Ink an e-paper page with next to no motion. The theme picker
  shows each one as the highlight moves onto it.

## Keys

kakel comes with:

| Key | |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Shift+T` | a new terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+D` / `Ctrl+Shift+E` | split right / split down |
| `Ctrl+Shift+W` | close the pane |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | the next / previous pane |
| `Ctrl+PageDown` / `Ctrl+PageUp` | the next / previous tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` | show every pane at once, and pick one |
| `Ctrl+Shift+K` | the command palette |
| `Shift+Win+K` (Windows), `Ctrl+Alt+K` (Linux) | the launcher, from any program |
| `Shift+PageUp` / `Shift+PageDown` | scroll the scrollback |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V` | copy and paste |
| `Ctrl+Alt+V` | paste an image as a file, and type its path |
| `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0` | font size |
| `Ctrl+Shift+B` | open or close the Servers pane |
| `Ctrl+Shift+L` | go to the Servers pane |
| `Ctrl+Shift+N` | connect to a server |
| `Ctrl+Shift+H` | every command and shortcut |
| `F10` | the menus |
| `Alt`, then an underlined letter | a menu, then a line in it |
| `F11` | fill the screen with the pane or split in front |

[USAGE.md](USAGE.md) covers the rest, and how to change a shortcut.

## An administrator shell on Windows

kakel has no setting to run a pane as administrator. On Windows 11 24H2
and later, Windows `sudo` can do it inside a normal pane:

```
sudo config --enable normal    # once: run elevated commands in the same pane
sudo pwsh                      # an administrator PowerShell, in this pane
```

The first line asks for UAC (User Account Control) itself, and can also
be set in Settings → System → For developers → Enable sudo → Inline.
Out of the box `sudo` is set to open a new window, which is a console
window outside kakel. Inline mode shares the pane with processes that
are not elevated, which is why Windows does not turn it on by default.

## Coming from gridterm

kakel is gridterm, renamed, with its window rebuilt on gunim.

- **Your files come along.** The first time kakel starts, it renames
  gridterm's directory, with the saved servers, secrets, themes, keys
  and shortcuts in it, to kakel's. A copy that carried a `gridterm-files`
  directory beside it carries it on as `kakel-files`.
- **A gridterm still installed keeps its files.** On Linux and macOS,
  kakel leaves a link at the old name, leading to its own directory, so
  both programs read the same files. On Windows there is no link:
  making one needs rights most users lack. A gridterm started there
  after kakel starts with no files.
- **Shortcut files keep working.** The commands kept gridterm's names.
- **A kakel and a gridterm still talk to each other.** The names they
  use between machines are unchanged, so windows of either can connect
  to each other.
- **An agent set up for gridterm is set up again for kakel.** The MCP
  server is now called kakel, and runs the kakel executable.

## How this was built

Each step was reviewed adversarially before the next one started, which
is where most of the interesting bugs came from: a crash on a
one-column screen, two denial-of-service paths, a deadlock between the
output pump and a device report, and a reaper that threw away a short
command's entire output. The commit messages record what each review
found.
